## Requesting a new term

Anyone can request a new term be added to the controlled vocabulary by opening an issue or a pull
request against this repository. We'd appreciate any help you can contribute when submitting a new
term, from proposing the term name and description to defining its relationships and properties. Submitting
the request already formatted as an OBO term is helpful too! Don't worry about finding an unused id string,
that can be handled near the end.

If you're requesting multiple related terms, you can submit them in a single issue/pull request.
